<h1>jQuery UI Touch Punch - test case</h1>
I've stumbled upon Touch Punch while I was looking, well - exactly for that plugin. It did not exactly cover my use case though. So I decided to fix it.
<h2>What is the problem?</h2>
<p>I've found that while:<br>
 - using jQuery UI Sortable (and probably other plugins also) with touch punch<br>
 - zooming in on mobile<br>
there is significant problem with offset of placeholder and helper. Their positioning is way off and plugin becomes unusable.
</p>
<h2>Test case</h2>
<p>I created test case in which you can see behavior of original version and my fork</p>
<h3>How to test?</h3>
<ol>
	<li><em>Use your mobile phone to test</em>
	<li> Go to each test file
	<li> Zoom in the page
	<li> Try dragging the items
	<li> Notice that with original plugin dragging is not very efective ;)
	<li> Look at the source code if you want
</ol>
<h3>Test cases</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="example/regular-table.html">Original - drag rows of a table :(</a>
	<li><a href="example/regular-div.html">Original - drag divs :(</a>
	<li><a href="example/fork-table.html">Fork - drag rows of a table :)</a>
	<li><a href="example/fork-div.html">Fork - drag divs :)</a>
	<li><a href="example/fork-table-norelative.html">Fork - drag rows of a table - w/o relative container :(</a>
	<li><a href="example/fork-div-norelative.html">Fork - drag divs - w/o relative container :(</a>
</ul>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Two things change between original plugin and fork:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Container of the sortable element has <i>position: relative</i>
	<li>I add scroll left and top to position touch.client* while sending simulated mouse event
</ol>
